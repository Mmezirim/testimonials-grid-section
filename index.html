                I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks were the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've succesfully switched career, working as a software engineer at a VR startup."

                "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code before.
                I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
                The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for their assistance.
                The agile team project in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way no tutorialcould ever have.
                In fact, I've often referred to it during my interviews as an example of my development experience.
                It certainly helped me land a job as fullstack developer after recieving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "
